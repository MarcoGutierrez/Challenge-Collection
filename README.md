This is a collection of code challenges I have completed or I have started working on. This will ideally let me post my solutions that I have personally crafted or did cited research to come to an answer.

#Nth Series
##Java

###Task:

Your task is to write a function which returns the sum of following series upto nth term(parameter).

Series: 1 + 1/4 + 1/7 + 1/10 + 1/13 + 1/16 +...
Rules:

You need to round the answer upto 2 decimal places and return it as String.
If the given value is 0 then it should return 0.00
You will only be given Natural Numbers as arguments.
Examples:

SeriesSum(1) => 1 = "1"
SeriesSum(2) => 1 + 1/4 = "1.25"
SeriesSum(5) => 1 + 1/4 + 1/7 + 1/10 + 1/13 = "1.57"s.




#Factorial
In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example: 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120. By convention the value of 0! is 1.

Write a function to calculate factorial for a given input. If input is below 0 or above 12 throw an exception of type ArgumentOutOfRangeException (C#) or IllegalArgumentException (Java).
