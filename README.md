#Nth Series 
##Java

###Task:

Your task is to write a function which returns the sum of following series upto nth term(parameter).

Series: 1 + 1/4 + 1/7 + 1/10 + 1/13 + 1/16 +...
Rules:

You need to round the answer upto 2 decimal places and return it as String.
If the given value is 0 then it should return 0.00
You will only be given Natural Numbers as arguments.
Examples:

SeriesSum(1) => 1 = "1"
SeriesSum(2) => 1 + 1/4 = "1.25"
SeriesSum(5) => 1 + 1/4 + 1/7 + 1/10 + 1/13 = "1.57"s.
